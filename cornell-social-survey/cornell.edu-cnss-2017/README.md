To use this package, you will have to download the research file manually,
placing the file in the data directory. Cornell requires you to accept terms
and conditions before downloading the file, so we can't redistribute it.

I used Stat Transfer to convert the SPSS file to Stata, but there is one
variable, KRq1, "Number of Dogs Owned", that StatTransfer converts with
duplicate labels.
