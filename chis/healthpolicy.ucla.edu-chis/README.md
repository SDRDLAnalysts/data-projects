	Restrictions on the Use of California Health Interview Survey Data Before you
	download this file, you must first agree to these Restrictions on the Use of
	CHIS Data by clicking the button below.

	The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) is bound by promises made to
	respondents, by California law, and by University and government human subject
	protection committees to assure that no personal information is released in a
	form that identifies an individual without the consent of the person who
	supplied the information. The California Information Practices Act (section
	1798.24) provides that the data collected by CHIS may be released only for
	statistical research and reporting purposes. Any intentional identification or
	disclosure of personal information violates this law, and violates the privacy
	rights of the people who provided data to CHIS. Unauthorized disclosure of
	personal information is subject to civil action and penalties for invasion of
	privacy under California Civil Code, Section 1798.53.
